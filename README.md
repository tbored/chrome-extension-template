# Chrome extension template

This is a small template for a chrome extension i made to save your time.
You can change the name of the extension in the manifest.json file.
You can also add your own description, and a favicon, but it's not included in the template.

### What do the files do?
The manifest.json file is essential for the chrome extension. In here, things like the name of the extension and the file directories are declared.
The content.js file is a javascript file that gets executed everytime you visit a website.
The popup.html file is an html file that gets shown when you  click on the extensions button on the top right and then click on your extension.

#### I hope you have fun building your own chrome extension. All you need is a little knowledge in javascript and html and you are good to go.
